I've added a new feature to my site: **Hidden Posts**.

They are posts that arn't linked from the home page, but are still accessible if you know the URL.

This is useful for more personal posts, that I don't want to show up to people who ran across my site on github, but still want to write. It's not a security boundry, but helps me feel more confident that I don't have to write to as high a standard.

They'll still show up on RSS though, because RSS people are cool. [^rss]

I have vague plans for what to use this feature for [^plans], but no promises.

[^rss]: I don't know if anyone reads my site via RSS. If you do, let me know, either on [github](https://github.com/aDotInTheVoid/aDotInTheVoid.github.io/issues/new), or [mastodon](https://social.treehouse.systems/@aDot), or bluesky.

[^plans]: Believe me, I'd not be hacking on features to my custom SSG if I wasn't going to use them.
